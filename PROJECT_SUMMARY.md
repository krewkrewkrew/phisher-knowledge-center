# PhishER Knowledge Center Project Summary

## üéØ Project Goal

To create a comprehensive, community-driven documentation repository for the KnowBe4 PhishER SOAR platform, focusing on integration, automation, and best practices. This project addresses the unique challenges of documenting a commercial security platform with limited public documentation by emphasizing API-first integration patterns and community-contributed content.
